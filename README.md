# AI Ethics Framework

## Overview

The AI Ethics Framework is a comprehensive tool designed to assess the ethical considerations of AI models across multiple principles. This framework evaluates AI systems based on fairness, transparency, accountability, privacy, safety, robustness, and explainability.

## Features

- **Fairness Assessment**: Evaluates demographic parity, equal opportunity, and disparate impact across sensitive attributes.
- **Transparency Evaluation**: Analyzes model documentation for architecture disclosure, training data description, performance metrics, and limitations.
- **Privacy Consideration**: Assesses data handling procedures, including data minimization, anonymization techniques, consent mechanisms, and retention policies.
- **Robustness Testing**: Checks adversarial robustness, out-of-distribution performance, and stability under data perturbations.
- **Comprehensive Evaluation**: Provides a holistic assessment across all ethical principles.

## Installation

```bash
pip install ai-ethics-framework
