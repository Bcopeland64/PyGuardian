# AI Ethics Framework

## Overview

The AI Ethics Framework is a comprehensive tool designed to assess the ethical considerations of AI models across multiple principles. This framework evaluates AI systems based on fairness, transparency, accountability, privacy, safety, robustness, and explainability.

## Features

- **Fairness Assessment**: Evaluates demographic parity, equal opportunity, and disparate impact across sensitive attributes.
- **Transparency Evaluation**: Analyzes model documentation for architecture disclosure, training data description, performance metrics, and limitations.
- **Privacy Consideration**: Assesses data handling procedures, including data minimization, anonymization techniques, consent mechanisms, and retention policies.
- **Robustness Testing**: Checks adversarial robustness, out-of-distribution performance, and stability under data perturbations.
- **Comprehensive Evaluation**: Provides a holistic assessment across all ethical principles.

## Installation

```bash
pip install ai-ethics-framework

```

## Usage

```python
from pyguardian import AIEthicsFramework

# Initialize the framework
framework = AIEthicsFramework()

# Evaluate your AI model
results = framework.evaluate(
    model=your_model,
    data=your_data,
    sensitive_attributes=["gender", "race"],
    documentation=model_documentation,
    governance_structure=governance_info,
    audit_trail=audit_info,
    data_handling_procedures=data_procedures,
    use_case=model_use_case,
    risk_assessment=risk_info,
    test_data=robustness_test_data,
    explainability_method=explainability_info
)

# Print the results
print(results)
```
## Detailed Framework Structure
The AIEthicsFramework class is the core of PyGuardian. It contains methods for assessing various ethical principles:

- **Fairness Assessment**: The assess_fairness method evaluates the model's fairness across multiple metrics:
  
- Demographic Parity
- Equal Opportunity
- Disparate Impact

**Transparency Evaluation**: The assess_transparency method analyzes the model's documentation for:

- Model Architecture Disclosure
- Training Data Description
- **Performance Metrics Disclosure
- Limitations Disclosure

**Privacy Consideration**: The assess_privacy method examines data handling procedures, checking for:

- Data Minimization
- Anonymization Techniques
- Consent Mechanisms
- Data Retention Policies

**Robustness Testing**: The assess_robustness method tests the model's resilience through:

- Adversarial Robustness Checks
- Out-of-Distribution Performance Evaluation
- Stability Under Data Perturbations

**Comprehensive Evaluation**: The evaluate method provides a holistic assessment across all ethical principles, combining the results from individual assessments.
